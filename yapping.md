* I love GNOME. It works well for me, and I've been using it for years. But I also love to tinker with my system and customize it to my liking. 

* I used to use Fedora, then switched to ZorinOS and used it for a while. I liked ZorinOS, but I wanted to try something new, an up-to-date system more than a stable and being left-behind system (although it's very stable and fast, just fast). 

* Then I found CachyOS, and I loved it:
  * Beautiful system
  * Snappy
  * Up-to-date
  * Based on Arch Linux

* But, that did not satisfy my need for customization. I know there are some WMs like Qtile, River... But it's hard to switch to a new WM, and I don't want to lose the GNOME experience. 

* I found Hyprland and AGS.
